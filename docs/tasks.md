# Laratoor Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of actionable tasks to improve the Laratoor package. Each task includes a checkbox that can be marked when completed.

## Code Organization and Architecture

2. [ ] Create interfaces for all service classes to improve testability and allow for alternative implementations
3. [ ] Refactor model classes to use a common base class to reduce code duplication
4. [ ] Implement data transfer objects (DTOs) for API requests to improve type safety
5. [ ] Add support for dependency injection in model classes instead of direct array access
6. [ ] Implement a logging system for API requests and responses
7. [ ] Create a configuration validator to ensure all required settings are provided
8. [ ] Implement a rate limiting mechanism to prevent API quota exhaustion

## Documentation

9. [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation using PHPDoc comments for all public methods
10. [ ] Add usage examples for each service class
11. [ ] Create a detailed getting started guide with examples

16. [ ] Create a changelog to track version changes

## Testing

17. [ ] Increase unit test coverage to at least 80% for all classes
18. [ ] Add tests for all service methods (currently only find() is tested in TournamentService)
19. [ ] Implement integration tests with mock API responses
20. [ ] Add tests for error handling and edge cases
21. [ ] Create test fixtures for common API responses
22. [ ] Implement contract tests to verify API compatibility
23. [ ] Add performance benchmarks for critical operations
24. [ ] Set up continuous integration for automated testing

## Error Handling and Validation

25. [ ] Implement input validation for all service methods
26. [ ] Create specific exception classes for different error types
27. [ ] Add retry logic for transient API errors
28. [ ] Improve error messages to be more descriptive and actionable
29. [ ] Implement proper handling of API rate limits
30. [ ] Add validation for configuration values
31. [ ] Implement proper handling of API version changes
32. [ ] Add support for debug mode with detailed error information

## Performance Optimization

33. [ ] Optimize pagination to use cursor-based pagination where supported
34. [ ] Implement request batching for multiple API calls
35. [ ] Add support for conditional requests using ETags
36. [ ] Optimize token caching strategy
37. [ ] Implement response caching for frequently accessed data
38. [ ] Add support for asynchronous requests
